## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m Amr Mohamed — a Senior Backend Engineer with 5+ years of experience building and scaling production-grade systems across fintech, healthcare, edtech, and SaaS.

Although I began my academic journey in Dentistry, I transitioned into software engineering in 2017 and have since specialized in backend architecture, performance optimization, and cloud infrastructure.

I focus on designing systems that are:

- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Observable
- Cost-efficient
- Aligned with business impact

I don’t just build features — I design systems meant to last.
